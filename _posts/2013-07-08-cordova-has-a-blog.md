Cordova Blog
---
Cordova has a Blog too, we establish this blog to share the latest information, interesting articles, and news about the project including release notes. With a major release [3.0](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB/fixforversion/12322491) just around the corner (July 19, 2013) we know that a lot of developers will want to know what's the latest with Cordova and will also want to share what cool stuff others are doing with Cordova. You can [subscribe](http://cordova.apache.org/rss.xml) using RSS

Contribute to the Blog
---
The Cordova Blog will be hosting blog posts submitted using [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB), its a very simple process just open a ticket and attach a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) file to the ticket and a project committer will post it to the website. If you already have a blog post maybe hosted on your own blog please follow the same process and give us the link and short excerpt to include in our blog. If the developer community thru the [dev mailing list](mailto:dev@cordova.apache.org) is cool with your submissions the post will be accepted for publishing.
